# ðŸª¨ Fat Fuzzy Rocks ðŸª¨

This project is a way to scratch my own itch:

- help me bootstrap new web applications (websites or other types)
- have a reliable UI library I can re-use as a source of truth common to my web projects
- keep track of new ideas and setup capabilities (back/front/design) as I go along

Ideally, this starter kit will meet the following requirements:

- [x] integrates a design workflow
- [x] is flexible
- [ ] is efficiently documented
- [ ] is well tested and easily testable
- [ ] has a low maintenance cost

## Packages

- **api** API code
- **client** frontend application structure
- **ui** frontend component library
- **design** design tokens and other relevant design resources
- **doc** decisions, UI library doc, other doc-worthy information
- **resources** backend resources (database, auth, storage, etc)
- **lib** libraries unrelated to building an interface or accessing backend resources (logic and experiments)
