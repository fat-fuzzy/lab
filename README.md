# ü™® üëæ ‚ú® Fat Fuzzy Rocks ü´ß üêô ü™®

This project aims to:

- provide a way to quickly bootstrap new web applications (websites or other types)
- be a learning resource

Ideally, this project will:

- [x] integrate a design workflow
- [x] be flexible
- [ ] be efficiently documented
- [ ] be well tested and easily testable
- [ ] have a low maintenance cost

## Getting started

This repository contains several packages, which can be used together or independently, depending on the use case.

### Use cases

üöß WIP: doc/usage

## Overview

This repository is organized into three workspaces:

- **apps** for client facing code, organized by project
- **packages** for backend logic, UI and web graphics libraries, as well as common config
- **infra** for infrastructure code
  - WIP

The initial motivation for this setup was usage of [Turborepo's workspaces conventions](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/getting-started/existing-monorepo#configure-workspaces). It will evolve when necessary.

### Apps

- **doc** This app is a website that uses the **ui** library package and that documents this project.
- **sandbox** A frontend application example that uses the **ui** library package

### Packages

- **api** API packages
- **design** A place to make design experiments and decisions
  - use this package to isolate design work from the UI library
  - test designs here: if the pattern can be re-used, _then_ consider migrating it as a component in the UI library
  - design assets and collections go here
- **lib** Libraries unrelated to building an interface or accessing backend resources (logic and experiments)
  - üëæ gfx - everything related to working with webgl
  - ü§ñ state machines
  - ‚ûï maths
    These libraries are generally always WIP unless specifically stated
- **resources** Backend resources (database, auth, storage, etc)
  - WIP
- **ui** A frontend component library
  - A UI library that can be used as a common source of truth for web projects
