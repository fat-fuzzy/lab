## Requirements

### No JS

For a button action to have an effect without JavaScript enabled, it must be inside a `<form>` element that has at least one defined `action`. By default, a button without a `type` attribute will be considered a 'submit' button: on click, it will submit the form it belongs to.

If a form contains more than one button with different actions expected on click, each button must have a distinct `formaction` attribute.
