In [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi), `Layouts` are [compositions](https://cube.fyi/composition.html). This means that `Layouts` are components used to structure and organize the content and interface elements it contains.

These Layouts are largely based on the teachings and examples put forth in [every-layout.dev](https://every-layout.dev/), and aim to use minimal HTML markup and carefully written CSS to work in harmony with the browsers's layout algorithms.

`Layouts` are designed to be combined with `Blocks` and other `Layouts` to create new components while maintaining the characteristics defined in the design system's `Tokens`.
