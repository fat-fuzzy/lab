`Layouts` are components that are used to organize how content is displayed on the screen, and designed to work in harmony with the browser's built-in layout algorithms.

These `Layouts` are largely based on the teachings and examples provided in [every-layout.dev](https://every-layout.dev/). The aim is to use minimal HTML markup and carefully written CSS that enables wide range of design options.

`Layouts` are designed to be [composed](https://cube.fyi/composition.html) with `Blocks` and other `Layouts` to create new components while maintaining the characteristics defined in the design system's `Tokens`.
