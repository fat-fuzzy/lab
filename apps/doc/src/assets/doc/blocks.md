Blocks are self contained, atomic components that provide a piece of information, action, or navigation option to the user of the app. They are generally mapped to a specific HTML tag, or related tags.

They are implemented using the [web platform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)'s capabilities and with help from the examples provided in [Inclusive Components](https://inclusive-components.design/).

Blocks can be [composed](https://cube.fyi/composition.html) with Layouts and other Blocks to create simple or elaborate interfaces while respecting HTML semantics and document structure.
