# Preprocess Markdown on SvelteKit

Vite does not currently enable export markdown assets for server side rendering (see: [GitHub issue #11430](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/11430))

To overcome this, I have adapted the packages from [bluwy/website/packages](https://github.com/bluwy/website/tree/f1aab96779efede611f91db93f9114f86c2cf105/packages) as a basis to build the markdown packages used in this folder

## Usage

[TODO]
