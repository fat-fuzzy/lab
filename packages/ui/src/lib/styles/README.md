# CSS Library

The work in this library is based on the ideas put forth in the following resources:

- [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi)
- [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev)
- [UTOPIA](https://utopia.fyi/)
- [Inclusive design principles](https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/)
- [Inclusive components](https://inclusive-components.design/)
- [Open Props](https://open-props.style/)

I particularly recommend reading this open access blog post on algorithmic design to get an understanding what this CSS library is aiming for:

- [Every Layout blog post on Algorithmic design](https://every-layout.dev/blog/algorithmic-design/)
