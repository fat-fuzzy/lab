Layouts are components that are used to organize how content is displayed on the screen, and designed to work in harmony with the browser's built-in layout algorithms.

These Layouts are largely based on the teachings and examples put forth in [every-layout.dev](https://every-layout.dev/), and aim to use minimal HTML markup and carefully written CSS that allow a varied range of design options.

Layouts are designed to be combined in [compositions](https://cube.fyi/composition.html). This means that a Layout can contain Blocks and other Layouts, which is a versatile yet intuitive way to create web page designs.
