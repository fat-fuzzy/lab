`Tokens` are the Design Tokens of the UI library.

Design Tokens are `[key, value]` pairs that define design choices such as `Color`, `Typography`, or `Scale`.
`Tokens` are defined using CSS variables, and are sometimes styled via native HTML tags (ex: `Typography` rules can target `h1` elements directly).

`Tokens` provide the base values used to build `Blocks`, `Layouts`, and `Compositions`.
