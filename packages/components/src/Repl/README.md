# REPL Component

REPL Component based on the following resources:

* Excellent talk by Peter Allen on creating a simple REPL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3j1fLzC8_E&list=PL8bMgX1kyZThM1sbYCoWdTcpiYysJsSeu&index=13
* I also found this article by Bruno Couriol, with plenty of resources from the talk: https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/10/svelte-simple-repl-summit-2020/
* And the article led me to find this repo that helped me get through some more hurdles! https://github.com/pngwn/REPLicant
